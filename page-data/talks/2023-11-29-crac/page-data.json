Native images are one solution to solve these problems because their statically ahead of time compiled code simply doesn’t have to warmup and so has short startup time. But even with the shorter startup time and smaller footprint it doesn’t come without a drawback. The overall performance might be slower because of the missing JIT optimisations at runtime. There is a new OpenJDK project called CRaC (Coordinated Restore at Checkpoint) which goal it is to address the JVM warmup problem with a different approach. The idea is to take a snapshot of the running JVM, store it in files and restore the JVM at a later point in time (or even on another machine).</p>\n<p>This session will give you a short overview of the CRaC project and shows some results from a proof of concept implementation.</p>","fields":{"slug":"/talks/2023-11-29-crac/"},"frontmatter":{"title":"What the CRaC - Superfast JVM startup","date":"2023-11-29T00:00:00.000Z","time":null,"virtual":null,"tags":[],"poster":null,"poster_alt":null}},"speakers":{"edges":[{"node":{"id":"dcff0301-b7e2-57b8-93a7-219a768e06e5","html":"<p>Gerrit Grunwald is a software engineer that loves coding for around 40 years already.
