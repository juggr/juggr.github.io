      <p>
        From Richard Hamming’s classic and must-read talk, “
        <a href="http://www.cs.virginia.edu/~robins/YouAndYourResearch.html">You and Your Research</a>
        ”.
      </p>
      <blockquote>
        <p>
          There is indeed an element of luck, and no, there isn’t. The prepared mind sooner or later finds something
          important and does it. So yes, it is luck.{" "}
          <em>The particular thing you do is luck, but that you do something is not.</em>
